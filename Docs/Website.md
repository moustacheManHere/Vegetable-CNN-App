Concept:
    - To abit of backstory to a boring image prediction site, I added a fictional character called "Tommy the Tomato"
    - The website will revolve around this Tomato predicting what vegetable photo you uploaded
    - Website will ideally be red themed around tomatos
    - The vegetable catalogue will accordinly be themed to be called "Tomato's Friends". The backstory is that just like our dataset has only 15 classes, there are only 15 vegetables in tomato's gang. This branding helps us add more vegetables to this dataset and widen tomato's gang. 
    - Login/Signup will be renamed as "Join Tomato's Gang"
